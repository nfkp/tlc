BICYCLE
wheel radius: 0.37[m]
gear ratio: 0.364/0.348
angle of rotation axis: 0.576[rad]
location of back wheel: vec3(0., -0.59819, 0.3688)[m]

REVOLUTION
const float coef = 1. / (2. * PI * 0.37[m])
vel_body * coef = vel_ang_wheel [rad/s]
vel_ang_wheel * 0.364 = vel_ang_pedal [rad/s]

STEERING
	Area3D ground surface has:
		static and kinetic force of friction
	

CONTROLS
W 		-> Pedal Forward
A/D 	-> Turn
S 		-> Put feet on ground
SPACE 	-> brake
